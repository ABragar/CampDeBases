Hi Andriy,
 
I have a new mission for you.
 
You probably remember your development to create the new PSG optin based on the LP_Prospects file.
 
We need to do exactly the same with another list of optins.
 
Those optins are in the fields :
 
optin_newsletter_thematique_ile_de_france
optin_newsletter_thematique_paris
optin_newsletter_thematique_seine_et_marne
optin_newsletter_thematique_yvelines
optin_newsletter_thematique_essonne
optin_newsletter_thematique_hauts_de_seine
optin_newsletter_thematique_seine_st_denis
optin_newsletter_thematique_val_de_marne
optin_newsletter_thematique_val_oise
optin_newsletter_thematique_oise
 
 
I join the specification of the Prospects file so you can match those fields with the column numbers.
 
 
I also created the new values in ref.Contenus (see attachment contenus.bcp ( output –w)).
 
 
So you need to change the .fmt file (see attachment), the structures of the prospects tables (see attachment) and the code of the procedures (see attachment).
 
As well as the PSG one, those optins don’t have a specific subscription date attached, so you can use the same method as for the PSG :
 
 
 
To give a date to a subscription or unsubscription, you will have to use the timestamp of the file when the value of optin_news_them_psg changes.
That’s for the running mode. To initialize the opt-ins, you will use the field date_souscr_nl_thematique. It’s not accurate but better than nothing.
 
 
 
I think the Prospects file that you already have contains those columns. If it’s not the case, let me know and I’ll send you a new one.
 
 
Thanks.
